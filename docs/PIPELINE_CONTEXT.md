Pipeline orientation. Much of it still holds — the generator, the feature
pipeline and the cadence facts are unchanged — but the model and result sections
describe G2. For the current entry point read [`README.md`](README.md), then
[`RESEARCH_LEDGER.md`](RESEARCH_LEDGER.md).

## What it does

Predicts spacecraft trajectory outcomes early from physics-invariant telemetry.
The repository now includes a calibrated synthetic pipeline from the Moon
through Neptune, sequential neural models, and non-neural baselines.

Current paper framing must be evidence-led: XGBoost on trajectory features
outperforms the Transformer on the current random mission split. Do not claim
that the Transformer is the strongest classifier.

## Stack

- **ML:** PyTorch `TrajectoryTransformer`, `TrajectoryLSTM`, and XGBoost baselines.
- **Backend:** FastAPI at `src/api/main.py` — `uvicorn src.api.main:app --port 8000` from project root
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite (no TypeScript), Recharts, Tailwind v4 (unreliable — use inline styles)
- **Local multi-planet data:** generated on this machine at
  `/media/Data/Coding/gmat-pred/data/` (NTFS drive, not the repo — too
  large for the Linux partition). Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
  Uranus generated via the original `build_database.py`; Neptune generated
  via the Numba JIT fast path (`experiments/numba_jit/`, see
  `docs/NUMBA_JIT_PROPAGATOR.md`). Individual planet source folders are
  kept at `/media/Data/Coding/gmat-pred/data/<planet>/` (regenerating
  Uranus/Saturn took 5-12 hours each with the original pipeline — do not
  delete without explicit confirmation). Final merged dataset (80K
  missions, all 8 sources) at
  `/media/Data/Coding/gmat-pred/data/merged_all_v2/missions.parquet` —
  this is the canonical path everything in this session's reports points
  at. An earlier intermediate merge without Neptune (`merged_all/`,
  70K missions) was deleted as redundant once Neptune was folded in.
  The `data/merged_through_neptune_15min/` path referenced elsewhere in
  this doc was the teammate's machine, not this one.
- **Important:** generated data, reports, logs, and checkpoints are ignored by Git.

## Model — TrajectoryTransformer (src/ml/model.py)

- d_model=128, nhead=8, num_layers=4, dim_feedforward=512, Pre-LayerNorm
- Learnable CLS token prepended to sequence, CLS output → classification head
- Input: 13 physics-invariant features → Output: logit → sigmoid → **P(success)**
- **CRITICAL: model outputs P(success). Always invert: `p_fail = 1 - prob`**

## 13 input features

```
rel_x, rel_y, rel_z    synodic frame position
spec_energy            specific orbital energy
fpa_deg                flight path angle
norm_target_dist       distance to target / SOI
radial_vel             dr/dt toward target
vel_mag                total speed
earth_rmag             distance from source body
ecc                    eccentricity
mu_ratio               target μ / Sun μ  (cross-planet context)
soi_ratio              target SOI / transfer dist
dist_ratio             transfer dist / 1 AU
```

## Current final dataset

- 80,000 missions: 25,590 success / 54,410 failure.
- Final success rate: 0.320.
- Moon telemetry cadence: 900 seconds.
- Interplanetary telemetry cadence: 54,000 seconds = 15 hours.
- Folder names containing `15min` are historical names; do not interpret them as cadence.
- Final model configuration: early exit 40%, downsample factor 10, seed 42.
- For interplanetary missions, downsample factor 10 means every tenth 15-hour
  record, not ten minutes.
- `create_dataloaders()` splits by mission ID and fits `RobustScaler` on train only.
- Baselines now use the exact same mission ordering and seeded split.

## Current verified results

| Model | Accuracy | F1 | ROC-AUC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Majority class | 67.35% | 0.0000 | 0.5000 |
| Energy threshold | 35.81% | 0.4964 | 0.5233 |
| Transformer, 40% trajectory | 79.73% | 0.7447 | 0.9363 |
| XGBoost, full summaries | 99.34% | 0.9899 | 0.9998 |
| XGBoost, first/last only | 99.33% | 0.9898 | 0.9998 |
| XGBoost, first row only | 98.42% | 0.9760 | 0.9987 |
| XGBoost, first row without context features | 98.42% | 0.9760 | 0.9987 |

Transformer training was interrupted after epoch 27 of 30 by laptop shutdown.
The best validation-loss checkpoint from epoch 23 survived and was evaluated
on the deterministic untouched test split.

The initial-only XGBoost result shows that current synthetic mission outcomes
are highly separable from initial conditions. This is not explicit target
column leakage, but it makes random mission splits optimistic. The next
paper-grade experiment should use grouped planet-held-out and/or
parameter-corridor-held-out evaluation.

Removing `mu_ratio`, `soi_ratio`, and `dist_ratio` from the initial-only
baseline does not reduce accuracy. Target-regime context is therefore not the
main cause of the near-perfect result; the initial dynamical state and
calibrated targeting corridors are.

## Gotchas

- **Model outputs P(success)** — invert to get P(fail) for display and cancel logic
- **Simulator cancel gate** — only cancel after `min_elapsed_pct` to stay in trained distribution
- **Tailwind v4** — unreliable for dynamic classes, use inline styles
- **Gradient text** — must use CSS class, not inline React style (WebKit bug)
- **ReduceLROnPlateau** — `verbose` kwarg removed in PyTorch 2.x
- **PyArrow** — `.to_numpy()` is read-only in numpy 2.x, always `.copy()`
- **Scaler** — fitted on train split only, saved alongside checkpoint, required at inference
- **Run server from project root** — `src.api.main` import path requires it
- **No explicit leakage features** — models use only the 13 features above;
  label, failure_type, min_target_rmag, mission_id, source_body, and target_body
  are not input features.
- **Context-feature caveat** — mu_ratio, soi_ratio, and dist_ratio identify
  mission regimes indirectly. Report this and test grouped generalization.
- **Initial-condition separability** — first-row XGBoost reaches 98.42%
  accuracy; random mission splits do not establish transfer to unseen planets
  or unseen targeting corridors.
