# OrbitGuard Research Ledger

This file is the running source of truth for paper writing. Update it whenever
data, code, model results, or scientific interpretation changes.

## Current Goal

Build a defensible OrbitGuard research paper on early spacecraft trajectory
outcome prediction across calibrated Moon-to-Neptune synthetic transfers.

The paper must be honest about what is proven and what is not proven. Strong
results on random mission splits are not enough if initial-condition corridors
make the task easy.

## Current Dataset State

- Final merged dataset: `data/merged_through_neptune_15min`
- Missions: 80,000
- Success count: 25,590
- Failure count: 54,410
- Success rate: 0.320
- Moon telemetry cadence: 900 seconds
- Interplanetary telemetry cadence: 54,000 seconds = 15 hours
- Historical folder names containing `15min` must not be interpreted as true
  interplanetary cadence.
- Final EDA: `reports/eda_merged_through_neptune_15min/eda_report.html`

**Note:** the numbers above came from a teammate's machine and were never
reproduced locally until the local-reproduction pass below. The dataset path
`data/merged_through_neptune_15min` does not exist on this machine — treat
it as historical context, not a live path.

## Local Reproduction (2026-06-21)

A full 80,000-mission, 8-source dataset was independently generated and
merged on this machine — same methodology (calibrated nominals, seed=42,
35% success bias, early-exit 0.4, downsample 10), not a copy of the
teammate's data. Mercury/Venus/Mars/Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus via the original
`build_database.py`; Neptune via a validated Numba JIT fast path
(`experiments/numba_jit/`, see `docs/NUMBA_JIT_PROPAGATOR.md`, 26-37x
speedup, validated against real production Jupiter data before trusting it).
Stored at `/media/Data/Coding/gmat-pred/data/merged_all_v2/` (71 GB, NTFS
drive — too large for the repo's Linux partition).

- Missions: 80,000 — success rate 32.0% (25,568 success / 54,432 failure),
  matching the teammate's 0.320 almost exactly. Good sanity check that the
  independently-generated dataset reproduces the same statistical profile.

### Verified random-split baselines (own data, not the teammate's)

Same config as before: early exit 0.4, downsample 10, seed 42.

| Model | Accuracy | F1 | ROC-AUC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Majority | 67.74% | 0.000 | 0.500 |
| Energy threshold | 44.09% | 0.536 | 0.535 |
| XGBoost summary | 99.44% | 0.991 | 1.000 |
| XGBoost endpoints | 99.14% | 0.987 | 0.999 |
| XGBoost initial | 98.29% | 0.974 | 0.998 |
| XGBoost initial no context | 98.33% | 0.974 | 0.998 |

Within ~1% of the teammate's reported numbers across the board — confirms
the local pipeline reproduces the same separability pattern.
Full table: `docs/STATISTICAL_AUDIT_SUMMARY_LOCAL.md`.

### Calibration audit (new — not in the teammate's original run)

Extended `grouped_baselines.py` / `parameter_holdout_baselines.py` to also
report PR-AUC, Brier score, ECE, and a confusion matrix per held-out
target/bin (`src/ml/calibration_utils.py`). This surfaced a distinction the
original F1/AUC-only audit could not make: **some "weak" targets are
calibration failures, not generalization failures.**

Ranking-works-but-threshold-fails cases (AUC >= 0.80, F1 collapses at 0.5):

- Uranus (LOTO): AUC=0.992, F1@0.5=0.000, ECE=0.203 — ranking is excellent,
  the 0.5 threshold is just wrong for this target's probability scale.
- Venus (LOTO): AUC=0.856, F1@0.5=0.000, ECE=0.335 — same pattern, weaker.
- TOI_V bin 4 (corridor holdout): AUC=0.978, F1@0.5=0.675, ECE=0.002 — low
  ECE here, so this one is closer to a genuine sparse-success edge case.
- AOP bin 1 (corridor holdout): AUC=0.885, F1@0.5=0.388, ECE=0.410 — highest
  ECE of any case; likely a mix of calibration failure and genuine boundary
  confusion (57% success rate, near the success/failure decision boundary).

Mars, Mercury, and Moon remain genuinely weak (AUC < 0.6, not just
miscalibrated) — see error analysis below for why.

### Multi-seed stability (new)

`src/ml/multi_seed_grouped.py` and `src/ml/multi_seed_parameter_holdout.py`
re-run every LOTO target and every corridor-holdout bin across seeds
[0,1,2,3,4]. Result: **std=0.000 across all seeds, for every target and
every bin.** The XGBoost configuration used here has no row/column
subsampling, so the model fit is deterministic given a fixed train/test
split — and since LOTO/corridor-holdout splits are themselves deterministic
(defined by target identity or quantile bin, not by seed), there is no
seed-to-seed variance to measure. This is a valid finding: it rules out
training randomness as an explanation for the weak Mars/Mercury/Moon/Venus
results — they are structural, not noise.

Separately, the **random-split** formal ablation (`src/ml/formal_ablation.py`)
genuinely varies the train/test partition by seed, and shows real (if tiny)
variance:

| Model | F1 (mean ± std) | AUC (mean ± std) | ECE (mean ± std) |
|---|---|---|---|
| XGBoost initial | 0.974 ± 0.001 | 0.998 ± 0.000 | 0.012 ± 0.000 |
| XGBoost summary | 0.992 ± 0.001 | 1.000 ± 0.000 | 0.003 ± 0.000 |

Transformer-sequential is reported as a single-run point estimate in the
same artifact, not a 5-seed CI — retraining the Transformer 5x on this 80K
dataset would take ~20+ hours on the available hardware (one run is already
~4-5 hours). This asymmetry is stated explicitly rather than silently
treating the two legs as equivalent evidence.

### Error analysis (new — `src/ml/error_analysis.py`)

For every weak LOTO target and corridor-holdout bin, computed standardized
train/test feature-distribution shift across the 13 input features. Result:
Mars, Mercury, Moon, and Venus all show large shifts in `dist_ratio`,
`earth_rmag`, `rel_x`, and `norm_target_dist` (0.8-43 standard deviations) —
features that encode transfer distance and target-body scale. Confusion
matrices confirm near-total collapse to the majority class for these
targets (e.g. Mercury: 0 predicted successes out of 2,155 actual successes).

**Interpretation:** full unseen-target transfer fails because each target
occupies a categorically different physical regime (distance, SOI scale),
not because the launch-parameter corridor is merely "harder." This is a
stronger, more specific claim than "generalization is mixed" — it points at
*why*. Within-target corridor holdout (TOI_V/AOP bins) avoids this because
the physical regime stays in-distribution; only the parameter values shift.
Full report: `docs/ERROR_ANALYSIS.md`.

### Multi-planet Transformer (complete)

`models/transformer_multiplanet/` — 50 total epochs (30 + a warm-started
continuation, since loss had not plateaued at epoch 30). Final test:
Accuracy 87.67%, F1 0.838, ROC-AUC 0.984. Per-target breakdown (random
split, all targets present in training) shows Mercury (PR-AUC 0.547) and
Moon (PR-AUC 0.851) as the hardest targets even in-distribution — full
detail in `docs/PAPER_READY_SUMMARY.md` §5b.

### Domain generalization baseline (complete — mixed result)

`--upweight-targets mars mercury moon venus --upweight-factor 2.0` via a
`WeightedRandomSampler` in `create_dataloaders`/`train.py`. Compared
against the unbalanced model's own 30-epoch checkpoint (not its extended
50-epoch result, which would have been an unfair comparison).

Result: oversampling weak targets is not a silver bullet. Moon improved
substantially (PR-AUC 0.294→0.654, F1 0.577→0.826) and Mars improved
slightly, but **Venus collapsed entirely** (F1 0.902→0.000), dragging
every aggregate metric down (accuracy 87.14%→80.00%, F1 0.826→0.756).
First implementation attempt was a pure inverse-target-count weighting,
which is a near no-op on this dataset since all 8 targets have exactly
10,000 missions each — caught via a standalone sampler test before
wasting a full training run, fixed by adding explicit per-target weight
overrides. Full numbers in `docs/PAPER_READY_SUMMARY.md` §6.

## Regime-Split Production Models (2026-07-18)

### Motivation

The single multi-planet Transformer showed AUC 0.984 on random splits but the
LOTO audit revealed it completely fails on unseen targets (Mercury, Mars, Moon
AUC ≈ 0.5 — worse than random). The root cause identified in the error analysis:
`dist_ratio`, `earth_rmag`, and `norm_target_dist` shift by 10–43 standard
deviations between inner and outer planets. A single model cannot handle both
physical regimes.

### Architecture

Two specialist Transformers, same hyperparams (d_model=128, nhead=8, 4 Pre-LN
layers, CLS token, early-exit=0.4), different downsample factors to match the
raw data cadence per regime:

| Regime | Planets | ds | Model path |
|--------|---------|---|---|
| Inner | Mercury, Venus, Mars | 15 | `models/inner_production/` |
| Outer | Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune | 50 | `models/outer_production/` |

Pre-downsampling for outer planets was done first to avoid writing ~43 GB of
temp files to the NTFS FUSE mount during training (`src/data_collection/presample.py`).

### Training results

Inner (Mercury/Venus/Mars, ds=15):
- Accuracy: ~98%, F1: 0.990, AUC: 0.997

Outer (Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune, ds=50, trained on `data/outer_ds50.parquet`):
- Accuracy: ~99%, F1: 0.990, AUC: 0.996

### RegimeRouter

`src/ml/regime_router.py` — loads both models at startup, selects the correct
one at inference time based on target body name, and applies the per-target
calibrated threshold. Falls back to inner model if target is unrecognised.

### Calibration bug found and fixed (2026-07-18)

The initial calibration used `f1_score(labels, preds, zero_division=0)` with
default `pos_label=1` (success). This optimises for predicting *successes*
correctly, not failures — so the optimal strategy is a threshold above any
P(fail) the model actually outputs, meaning the abort system never fires.

**Fix applied to `src/ml/per_target_calibration.py`:**
- Changed to `pos_label=0` to optimise failure-class F1
- Sweep now starts from 0.005 (was 0.02) for finer granularity near zero
- AUC was also computed inverted (passed P(fail) as score for positive class);
  fixed to negate probs: `roc_auc_score(labels, [-p for p in probs])`
- `load_missions` now uses per-regime downsample automatically (ds=15 inner,
  ds=50 outer) — the old `--downsample` CLI arg is removed since it was a
  single value applied to all targets

**Action required:** re-run calibration after this fix to update
`models/thresholds.json`:

```bash
/home/haise/Coding/venvs/gmat-pred/bin/python3 -m src.ml.per_target_calibration \
  --data /media/Data/Coding/gmat-pred/data/merged_all_v2/missions.parquet \
  --models-dir models \
  --early-exit 0.4 \
  --output models/thresholds.json
```

The thresholds currently in `models/thresholds.json` were computed with the
wrong metric and should not be trusted for abort decisions until re-calibration
completes.

## Live Simulator (2026-07-18)

### Physics trajectory generator (`src/api/trajectory_gen.py`)

Two-body solar gravity RK4 propagator with circular planetary orbits. Given a
target planet, launch energy (C3 in km²/s²), and departure phase angle, it
computes a complete synthetic interplanetary trajectory and extracts all 13
training features at each timestep. Feature normalization matches the training
schema exactly:
- `norm_target_dist = dist / SOI` (not initial dist)
- `soi_ratio = SOI / dist`
- `dist_ratio = dist / AU`

`hohmann_c3(target)` and `optimal_phase_deg(target)` expose the minimum-energy
Hohmann transfer parameters for each planet. The success criterion is
`dist_to_target < 1.5 × SOI`.

### Stream endpoint changes

- `step_delay_ms` hardcoded to 10 ms server-side; playback speed is
  frontend-controlled via the buffered playback system
- ML inference stride: `total_steps // 150` (was `// 60`) — 2.5× more inference
  calls emitted per mission for smoother spacecraft animation
- Calibrated threshold applied automatically; sent in SSE `info` header as
  `calibrated_threshold`

### Simulator frontend (`frontend/src/panels/Simulator.jsx`)

- Buffered SSE playback: all steps stream into `bufferRef` at server speed;
  `playTimerRef` drives display at user-selected rate
- Speed controls: 4×/2×/1×/½×/¼×/STEP frame-by-frame
- Pause/Resume during active stream
- Orbital map hover-scrub (after completion only — disabled during live playback
  to prevent position interference)
- Abort detail row: shows elapsed %, P(fail) at abort, calibrated threshold used,
  and excess above threshold
- Regime and calibrated threshold displayed in probability panel during stream

## Code/Branch State

- GitHub branch pushed for teammate review:
  `codex/fix-baseline-split-cadence`
- Pushed branch includes calibrated generation, targeting, adaptive propagation,
  training/model fixes, and baseline split/cadence fixes.
- Latest local audit additions are not pushed yet:
  - `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md`
  - `docs/PAPER_VALIDITY_AUDIT.md`
  - `docs/RESEARCH_LEDGER.md`
  - `src/ml/baselines.py`
  - `src/ml/dataset.py`
- Reason: final commit/push was blocked by tool approval usage limit.

## Final Transformer Result

Configuration:

- Data: `data/merged_through_neptune_15min/missions.parquet`
- Model: Transformer binary classifier
- Early exit: 0.4
- Downsample factor: 10
- Seed: 42
- Batch size: 32
- Training request: 30 epochs
- Completed: interrupted by laptop shutdown after epoch 27
- Best validation epoch by loss: 23

Held-out test result from saved best checkpoint:

- Accuracy: 79.7250%
- Loss: 0.3926
- F1: 0.7447
- ROC-AUC: 0.9363
- Confusion: TP=3549, FP=2064, FN=369, TN=6018

Paper interpretation:

- This checkpoint is usable because it was selected by validation loss and
  evaluated on an untouched deterministic test split.
- Do not claim uninterrupted 30-epoch training.
- Do not claim the Transformer is the strongest classifier.

## Baseline and Validity Audit

Same split/config as Transformer: early exit 0.4, downsample factor 10, seed 42.

| Model | Accuracy | F1 | ROC-AUC |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Majority class | 67.35% | 0.0000 | 0.5000 |
| Energy threshold | 35.81% | 0.4964 | 0.5233 |
| Transformer | 79.73% | 0.7447 | 0.9363 |
| XGBoost full summary | 99.34% | 0.9899 | 0.9998 |
| XGBoost first/last only | 99.33% | 0.9897 | 0.9997 |
| XGBoost initial row only | 98.42% | 0.9760 | 0.9987 |
| XGBoost initial row without context | 98.42% | 0.9760 | 0.9987 |

Confirmed:

- Model inputs are the 13 intended physics/context features only.
- Forbidden columns are not model inputs:
  `label`, `failure_type`, `min_target_rmag`, `mission_id`,
  `source_body`, `target_body`.
- Removing summary statistics does not reduce XGBoost performance.
- Removing context features (`mu_ratio`, `soi_ratio`, `dist_ratio`) from the
  initial-only XGBoost model does not reduce performance.

Scientific conclusion:

- The current random mission split is highly predictable from initial
  dynamical state.
- This is not explicit label leakage.
- It is likely calibrated synthetic-corridor separability.
- Random-split results alone are not enough for strong generalization claims.

## Paper-Safe Claims

Safe:

- The dataset and pipeline support multi-target synthetic trajectory generation
  through Neptune.
- The current feature pipeline avoids explicit target/outcome leakage columns.
- On a random mission split, early outcome prediction is highly accurate.
- XGBoost is the strongest current classifier on this random split.
- The Transformer is a sequential neural baseline with useful ROC-AUC but is
  not state-of-the-art for this dataset.

Unsafe unless further validated:

- Claiming Transformer superiority.
- Claiming generalization to unseen planets.
- Claiming real-world mission readiness.
- Claiming early-exit intelligence beyond calibrated initial-corridor
  separability.

## Next Required Experiment

Run a harder generalization audit before final paper claims:

1. Leave-one-planet-out evaluation:
   train on all targets except one, test on the held-out target.
2. Parameter-corridor holdout:
   train on some launch-parameter regions, test on unseen regions.

Acceptance:

- Report random-split results and grouped-split results separately.
- If grouped-split performance drops, state it clearly and frame the result as
  synthetic-corridor dependence.
- If grouped-split remains strong, the paper becomes much stronger.

## Leave-One-Target-Out Result

Completed for XGBoost summary and initial-no-context baselines.

Strong held-out transfer:

- Jupiter: summary F1 0.997, AUC 0.999
- Saturn: summary F1 1.000, AUC 1.000
- Uranus: summary F1 0.984, AUC 0.992

Weak or failed operational transfer:

- Mars: summary F1 0.000, AUC 0.436
- Mercury: summary F1 0.000, AUC 0.607
- Moon: summary F1 0.000, AUC 0.262
- Neptune: summary F1 0.000, AUC 1.000
- Venus: summary F1 0.000, AUC 0.324

Interpretation:

- Random-split results overstate deployment-level generalization.
- Some held-out targets have good ranking but bad probability calibration.
- Full unseen-target generalization is not solved.
- This is useful, not bad: it tells us exactly what claim reviewers could
  attack and how to strengthen the paper.

Updated next experiment:

- Prefer parameter-corridor holdout within each target over more zero-shot
  planet experiments. The operational claim is mission-family screening, not
  necessarily transfer to a completely unseen planet.

## Parameter-Corridor Holdout Result

Completed for `TOI_V` and `AOP` quintile bands within each target.

Mean summary-XGBoost performance:

- `TOI_V` holdout: Accuracy 97.97%, F1 0.798, AUC 0.986
- `AOP` holdout: Accuracy 90.10%, F1 0.684, AUC 0.978

Mean initial-no-context performance:

- `TOI_V` holdout: Accuracy 95.51%, F1 0.587, AUC 0.939
- `AOP` holdout: Accuracy 88.68%, F1 0.503, AUC 0.864

Interpretation:

- This supports in-family parameter interpolation better than zero-shot
  unseen-planet transfer.
- Summary features generalize better than initial-only features, so temporal
  trajectory information adds value for corridor holdout.
- Edge bins with very low success rates have weak F1 despite high accuracy/AUC.
- `AOP` bin 1 is a real failure case and must be disclosed.

Current strongest paper framing:

- OrbitGuard's synthetic mission-family screening is promising under
  random-split and parameter-corridor holdout.
- Full unseen-target generalization remains unsolved.
- XGBoost trajectory summaries are the strongest current model; Transformer is
  a neural sequential baseline, not the leading classifier.

## Reviewer Risk Register

See `docs/REVIEWER_RISK_REGISTER.md`.

See `docs/STATISTICAL_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md` for paper-ready tables generated from
the random-split, leave-one-target-out, and parameter-corridor JSON artifacts.

Highest-risk claims to avoid:

- Transformer superiority.
- Unseen-planet robustness.
- Flight-readiness or operational cancellation readiness.
- 15-minute interplanetary cadence.

Highest-value current claim:

- Within calibrated synthetic mission families, trajectory-summary features
  provide strong early ranking performance under unseen launch-parameter
  corridor holdout, while full unseen-target transfer remains mixed.

## Critique Policy

Do not optimize for making the numbers look good. Optimize for claims that can
survive reviewer scrutiny.

When a result is suspiciously strong, audit leakage and split design before
celebrating it.

When a model underperforms a simpler baseline, report that honestly and adjust
the contribution framing.

## Per-Planet Model Rebuild (2026-08-02)

### Symptom

The regime-split production models (`models/inner_production`,
`models/outer_production`) failed to catch failures in the live simulator
despite reporting val AUC 0.955 (inner) and 0.997 (outer) during training.
Measured on real missions through the serving path:

| Planet  | AUC  | P(fail) spread across missions |
|---------|------|--------------------------------|
| Venus   | ~0.5 | 2.4e-7 — constant 0.020910     |
| Mars    | 0.61 | 0.047                          |
| Jupiter | 0.87 | 0.99                           |

### Root cause

The regime models fitted **one scaler across 3–4 planets**. That scaler's IQR
spans the cross-planet range (`spec_energy` IQR = 23.6 covering Mercury through
Mars), so within-planet mission-to-mission variation was compressed to ~1e-5 of
the input range — below what gradient descent can learn to amplify, and Pre-LN
LayerNorm removes what survives. The network converged to a per-planet constant.

The high training AUC was measuring **cross-planet** ranking (the model learned
"Venus scores 0.02, Mars 0.11, Mercury 0.19"), not within-planet discrimination,
so a mixed validation set looked healthy.

This went undetected for a long time because **XGBoost baselines were
unaffected**: trees split on absolute feature values and need no amplification.
On the identical data and identical scaler, XGBoost scored AUC 1.0000 (Jupiter),
0.9999 (Venus), 0.9997 (Mercury), 0.9991 (Mars). The baselines were reporting
that the task was solved while the deployed model could not do it at all.

Two hypotheses were tested and **rejected**:
- *Padded vs unpadded inference mismatch* — outputs are byte-identical.
- *float32 precision loss* — global RobustScaler in float32 preserves XGBoost
  AUC 1.0. An earlier claim that scaled features were bit-identical was an
  artifact of `np.round(..., 4)` in a debug print.

### Fix

1. **One model per planet** — the scaler sees a single planet, so within-planet
   spread occupies the full dynamic range.
2. **Per-timestep z-scoring** — each feature standardised against its
   distribution at that timestep index across missions. Controlled experiment,
   same architecture and seed, only normalisation differing:

   | Planet  | global RobustScaler | per-timestep z |
   |---------|--------------------|----------------|
   | Venus   | 0.9978 | 0.9987 |
   | Mars    | 0.9386 | **0.9976** |
   | Mercury | 0.9944 | 0.9995 |
   | Jupiter | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |

3. **Random-prefix training** — prefix fraction sampled per batch, so the model
   is in-distribution at any streaming position rather than only at the 40%
   horizon. (The old stream called inference all the way to 100%, far outside
   its training window, which drove every outer-planet mission to a false abort
   near 70%.)
4. **Dual head** — outcome plus failure mode from a shared trunk.
5. **Threshold = plateau midpoint** of failure-class F1 on validation, instead
   of the first maximum, which parked Mercury at 0.010 (the sweep's lower bound).

### Result (1,200 held-out missions per planet, 40% observed)

Overall recall 0.9955, precision 0.9965, F1 0.9960, failure-mode accuracy
0.9792. Per-planet F1 ranges 0.9912 (Venus) to 1.0000 (Saturn, Neptune).
Accuracy is flat from 10% to 40% observed, indicating the outcome is largely
determined by injection conditions.

### Open items

- **Near-nominal grazing cluster.** Each planet's dataset begins with targeter
  nominal seeds whose closest approach forms a tight spike (Jupiter
  `min_target_rmag` 71,993–72,003 km). Recall there is 0.067 for Uranus (119
  missions) and 0.90 for Mercury (163); other planets are unaffected. This is
  the dominant residual error and pulls full-population Uranus recall to 0.9832.
  These trajectories are indistinguishable from precise targeted transfers over
  the observed window and only fail at arrival — a genuine information limit at
  40%, not obviously a modelling defect.
- **Synthetic missions are out-of-distribution.** `src/api/trajectory_gen.py`
  uses heliocentric two-body physics; training data is GMAT-derived with an
  Earth-centric departure, so `spec_energy`/`ecc`/`earth_rmag` reference a
  different body (Venus: +9.10 vs −514.9). Two context features (`soi_ratio`,
  `dist_ratio`) were also being recomputed per timestep instead of held constant
  — fixed. The remaining reference-frame mismatch is not fixed; the router now
  flags |z| far outside the training range and withholds the abort instead of
  emitting a confident wrong verdict. Scoring generated missions properly
  requires modelling the LEO departure and hyperbolic escape.
- `src/ml/regime_router.py` and `src/ml/per_target_calibration.py` are
  superseded by `planet_router.py` and `recalibrate.py`. Kept for provenance of
  the earlier results; no longer imported by the API.

## Corrections and Final State (2026-08-02, later)

### Data-alignment defect (invalidated two earlier analyses)

`missions.parquet` is **not** sorted by `mission_id`, and `summary.parquet` is
not either. The per-planet `.npz` extracts store missions in *file* order. Any
join by row position therefore pairs unrelated missions.

Two analyses were wrong because of this and have been redone:

1. The "near-nominal grazing cluster" finding — that Uranus recall was 0.067 on
   a cluster of 119 missions selected by `min_target_rmag`, and that the first
   240 missions per planet were an unrepresentative pool. The *selection* was
   built from a positional join and did not identify the missions it claimed.
2. `prune_economics.py` — `load()` concatenated params and summary by row
   position. Its first results (T0 saving 67.7% at 5.9% false-prune, Uranus T0
   false-prune 31.2%) were artifacts. The Uranus 31.2% figure had been used to
   argue that the cascade was necessary; it is actually 0.0%.

Fix: `src/data_collection/recover_mission_ids.py` attaches a `mission_ids` array
to every extract, and joins are now on the key with `validate="one_to_one"` and
an assertion on labels.

### Uranus rare-mode blind spot: real, and fixed

With correct labels the blind spot survives, but it is a *failure-mode* problem,
not a `min_target_rmag` cluster: Uranus `surface_impact` (119 of 6,611 failures)
had sequence recall **0.000**, while every other planet handles that mode at
0.95–1.00.

It is not an information limit. XGBoost on the identical per-timestep
z-normalised 40% window separates Uranus surface_impact from success at
**AUC 1.000**. Mode-balanced resampling up to 45x (`mode_alpha` 0 / 0.5 / 1.0)
left recall at exactly 0.000, so the sequence model cannot reach a signal that is
demonstrably present in its own input — an optimisation limit.

Resolved by fusing a per-planet tree assist at the decision window
(`src/ml/train_assist.py`): Uranus surface_impact 0.000 → 1.000, overall
held-out F1 0.9960 → **0.9981**, recall **0.9991** (5 false negatives in 8,400).

### Does the sequence model earn its place? No, on this dataset

| Screen | Compute saved | Good missions destroyed |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------|
| T0 (launch params, before propagating) | 64.6% | 0.8% |
| T40 (telemetry Transformer) | 38.9% | 0.2% |
| Cascade | 65.5% | 1.3% |

T0 reaches AUC 0.9975–1.0000 and predicts the failure mode at 0.96–0.99 — equal
to the sequence model on both tasks, at zero propagation cost. The cascade buys
0.9 pp of savings for 0.5 pp more false prunes and is not worth its complexity.

The reason is structural: the simulator is deterministic, so outcome is a fixed
function of the six injection offsets and the trajectory is their integral. It
cannot carry information the parameters do not already have. Logistic regression
scores AUC 0.49 (chance), so the map is strongly nonlinear — this is a case for
ML, but not for a sequence model.

**Implication for the paper.** The "early trajectory prediction saves compute"
framing is not defensible on this dataset. Two claims are defensible: the
normalisation-collapse methodology finding, and a quantified pruning result whose
honest conclusion is that input-space screening dominates. Making the sequential
framing viable requires data where the outcome is *not* determined at t=0
(mid-flight perturbations, unmodelled dynamics, or sensor noise) — new data
generation, not new modelling.

## Evaluation Hardening (2026-08-16)

A pre-writeup audit pass. No modelling changes; the models on disk are the ones
trained on 2026-08-02. What changed is how they are evaluated, what is committed,
and which documents are allowed to be quoted.

### Two selection biases in the economics table, found and removed

`prune_economics.py` produced the headline table under two biases:

1. **Oracle thresholding.** `threshold_at_recall()` was called with the test
   split's own labels, so the 99%-failure-recall operating point was chosen with
   knowledge of the answers. No deployed screen can do that.
2. **Contaminated evaluation set.** The script drew its own 70/30 partition at
   seed 42 while `per_planet_train.py` used 70/15/15 at seed 42 — same seed,
   same N, therefore the same permutation. Its "test" set was exactly the
   model's validation split plus its test split. Verified directly: 1,500 of the
   3,000 missions scored per planet were the ones the checkpoint and abort
   threshold had been selected on. Zero overlap with the training rows, so this
   was model-selection leakage rather than train-on-test.

Corrected protocol: thresholds fitted on validation, applied unchanged to the
untouched test 15%, achieved recall reported as a measured quantity.

| Screen | Published | Corrected |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| T0 compute saved | 64.6% | 64.5% |
| T0 good missions destroyed | 0.8% | 0.76% |
| T40 compute saved | 38.9% | 38.3% |
| T40 good missions destroyed | 0.2% | 0.21% |
| Cascade saved / destroyed | 65.5% / 1.3% | 65.0% / 1.62% |
| T0 failure recall | 99% by construction | 99.06% measured |

The conclusion is unchanged and the headline moved by 0.1 pp. Worth stating
explicitly: **both biases flattered T40**, the screen this analysis concludes
against, so the negative result survives its own correction. The cascade looks
slightly worse than before (1.62% vs 1.3% false prunes) because its confidence
quantile is now selected on validation too, which is the honest version.

Root cause of (2) was three independent copies of the split arithmetic —
`per_planet_train.py`, `test_ml.py` (carrying the comment "must stay in sync with
it") and `prune_economics.py`. Two agreed and one did not. `src/ml/splits.py` is
now the single definition; the comment-enforced invariant is gone.

### Moon: excluded by decision rather than by accident

The economics table has always covered seven targets, because `moon.npz` was
regenerated after `recover_mission_ids.py` ran and therefore lacks the
`mission_ids` key, and the script printed a skip line and continued. Nothing
recorded this.

Moon is now excluded on the merits — not an interplanetary transfer, 6-day
trajectory inside Earth's SOI at 60 s cadence against 127–13,419 propagation-day
heliocentric transfers at 15 h, sharing neither the cost structure the economics
are built on nor the dynamical regime, and already the worst LOTO case
(AUC 0.296). `planet_config.py` now distinguishes `PLANETS` (seven-target study
set, everything reported) from `SERVING_TARGETS` (eight, what the router and API
load). The live simulator still offers Moon.

Reported results are therefore 70,000 missions across seven targets, from an
80,000-mission eight-target generation.

### Documentation: three generations, now labelled

`docs/` had accumulated results from three model generations with nothing
marking which was current, so sequence-model accuracy appeared as 79.73% (G1),
87.67% (G2) and 99.81% (G3) in three files, all correct for their generation and
mutually contradictory as written. Added `docs/README.md` as the generation map,
banners on the eight superseded documents, and `docs/LIMITATIONS.md`.

`REVIEWER_RISK_REGISTER.md` was rewritten rather than bannered: it is
forward-looking guidance and was steering claims using a model that no longer
exists. Its Risk 2 ("the Transformer is not the best model") was stale in its
stated form — the G3 per-planet model reaches F1 0.9981 — but the conclusion it
guarded survives in a stronger form, now stated as the T0-vs-T40 comparison.

### Reproducibility

- `src/paths.py` resolves the dataset root from `$ORBITGUARD_DATA`; the
  reference machine's absolute path had been pasted into nine files.
- `reports/` result artifacts (JSON/TeX/MD, ~536 KB) are now tracked. Every
  number in `docs/` derives from one of these and none were committed, so no
  claim had anything on disk backing it.
- `requirements.txt` pinned to the versions the results were produced under.
  `numba` was missing entirely, which had made `experiments/numba_jit/` silently
  unrunnable.

### Still open

Single-seed headline results (WP4) — documented in `LIMITATIONS.md` §1 rather
than closed. ~1 hour of compute; not spent yet. Report as point estimates.

## Serving-Layer Audit (2026-08-16)

The ML side has been audited repeatedly; the serving layer never had been, and
it had no tests. Everything below was found by running the API rather than
reading it.

### The synthetic-mission OOD item is resolved

The 2026-08-02 open item "Synthetic missions are out-of-distribution" is stale.
`src/api/mission_builder.py` fixed it by building user missions through the same
propagator and feature code as the dataset (`gmat_runner.run_synthetic`) instead
of the simplified heliocentric path in `trajectory_gen.py`. Verified by scoring
built missions through the router:

| Target  | Offset      | Label | P(fail) | OOD   |
|---------|-------------|-------|---------|-------|
| Venus   | nominal     | 1     | 0.0001  | False |
| Venus   | dv_V +0.05  | 0     | 1.0000  | True  |
| Mars    | nominal     | 1     | 0.0002  | False |
| Mars    | dv_V +0.05  | 0     | 1.0000  | True  |
| Jupiter | nominal     | 1     | 0.0008  | False |

Nominal missions score in-distribution and correctly; perturbed ones are caught.
The OOD flag on the perturbed inner-planet cases is correct behaviour, not a
defect — dispersions are tiny (Venus dv_V sigma = 0.003 km/s) so a 0.05 km/s
offset is genuinely tens of sigma outside the sampled corridor, and the verdict
is still right.

`trajectory_gen.py` survives only as the source of heliocentric planet constants
and Hohmann helpers for the creator UI. It no longer generates scored missions.

### Moon was unreachable from the mission creator

`/api/simulator/planet_info` iterated `trajectory_gen.PLANET_DATA` — heliocentric
targets only — so Moon was absent from the response that drives the creator UI,
despite `build_mission("moon")` working, the Moon model being trained and served
(test F1 0.9888), and the planet dropdown listing it. The endpoint now iterates
`SERVING_TARGETS` and marks Moon `frame: "earth-centric"` with the heliocentric
fields explicitly null. End-to-end check: a perturbed Moon mission now builds,
streams, and aborts at 40.2% observed with the correct failure mode
(`orbit_too_high`, confidence 1.0, not flagged OOD).

### The dataset path was wrong on both sides

The three simulator endpoints defaulted to `data/merged/missions.parquet`, a
March generation the per-planet models were never trained on. Nothing hit that
default only because the frontend overrode it on every request with
`/media/Data/.../merged_all_v2/missions.parquet` — an absolute path compiled into
the JS bundle and shipped to the browser, which cannot work for a dashboard
deployed to Vercel. Server resolves from `$ORBITGUARD_DATA` now; the client sends
nothing unless a deliberate override is typed.

### Fake telemetry in the dashboard header

The three header lamps were string literals — "ALLOCATED // 98%",
"MOUNTED // SECURE", "IDLE_READY" — rendered on every screen regardless of
backend state. A GPU utilisation figure that is a hardcoded string is worse than
no figure. They poll `/api/system` now and degrade to OFFLINE in red when the
backend is unreachable.

### Tests

`test_api.py` mounts the app in-process and covers the above: dataset
resolution, planet_info and threshold coverage over the serving set, per-target
mission building, and an end-to-end abort. 24/24 passing. It exists because
every defect in this section was invisible until someone opened the dashboard.

## C1 Rebuilt, and Partly Refuted (2026-08-16, later)

The normalisation ablation in "Per-Planet Model Rebuild" above — the table at
§"Fix" item 2 showing Mars val AUC 0.9386 → 0.9976 from per-timestep
normalisation alone — was never reproducible. No script produced it. It has now
been rebuilt as `src/ml/norm_ablation.py`, and **the rebuilt experiment
contradicts it.**

### What the ablation actually shows

Three conditions, identical architecture, seed and split; only pooling differs.

| Target  | per-timestep | global (1 target) | grouped (regime group) | grouped output std |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Venus   | 0.9999      | 0.9947            | **0.6037**             | **3.11e-05**       |
| Mercury | 0.9994      | 0.9970            | 0.9069                 | 4.25e-01           |
| Mars    | 0.9994      | 0.9972            | 0.9422                 | 4.06e-01           |
| Jupiter | 1.0000      | 1.0000            | 0.9997                 | 4.75e-01           |

Three corrections to the earlier account:

1. **Pooling a single target's own timesteps does not cause the collapse.** The
   "global" column costs at most 0.005 AUC. The old table attributed the effect
   to this comparison; it is not there.
2. **The collapse requires pooling across targets**, which is what the regime
   models did. That is a sharper claim than "sharing a scaler", and it is the
   one the paper now makes.
3. **It is selective — one target of four.** Only Venus degenerates to a
   constant. The others degrade and keep working. Severity does not follow the
   signal ratio either: Jupiter is compressed harder than Mercury (0.0247 vs
   0.0484) and loses far less, because its task is separable enough to survive
   attenuation. Compression is necessary, not sufficient. The predictive rule
   WP2 hoped for ("collapse when the ratio exceeds X") is **not supported**.

Scope: this ablation isolates normalisation alone — one model per target, only
the statistics pooled. The production incident additionally shared one model
across the group. These numbers are a lower bound on that failure, not a
reproduction of it.

### The half that holds completely

`src/ml/baseline_invariance.py` — XGBoost on the identical normalised window
scores 0.9996–1.0000 under all three conditions, spread ≤ 0.0002. On Venus under
grouped normalisation the tree reports **AUC 1.0000** while the network emits a
constant at 0.6037. The baseline is blind to the defect on every target, not
only the one that collapsed, so this result is not anecdotal.

### C3 confirmed, with a denominator correction

`src/ml/rare_mode_sweep.py`: Uranus `surface_impact` recall is exactly **0.0000**
at mode_alpha 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0, while a tree on the identical window reaches AUC
1.0000 and recall 1.0000. Optimisation limit, measured rather than asserted.

The "45x" oversampling quoted here and in `train_assist.py` is against the
majority failure mode (4113/91). Relative to uniform sampling — what the sampler
applies — the maximum is **19.2x**. Both describe the same run; state the
denominator when quoting either.

### Consequence

`RESEARCH_PROPOSAL.md` C1 is corrected in place. Anyone drafting from the
proposal's original C1 wording would have written a claim this repository's own
experiment refutes.

## Multi-Seed Replication of C1 (2026-09-09)

`LIMITATIONS.md` §1 and WP4 both flagged single-seed as the largest open gap on
the headline results — "cheap, not done". It is now done for the two C1
experiments. `src/ml/norm_ablation.py` and `src/ml/baseline_invariance.py` were
re-run at seeds 0, 1, 2 and 3 alongside the existing seed 42, writing to
`reports/multiseed_paper/`. Each seed redraws the train/val/test partition as
well as the initialisation, so this is not just training noise.

### The compression is deterministic; the collapse is not quite

Venus, grouped normalisation, per seed:

| Seed | grouped AUC | P(fail) std | signal ratio | collapsed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 42 | 0.6037 | 3.11e-05 | 0.00229 | yes |
| 0  | 0.5338 | 3.91e-05 | 0.00222 | yes |
| 1  | 0.5773 | 1.57e-05 | 0.00232 | yes |
| 2  | 0.8108 | 4.84e-05 | 0.00229 | yes |
| 3  | 0.9305 | 3.64e-02 | 0.00227 | **no** |

Two things to take from this.

**The signal ratio barely moves** — 0.00222 to 0.00232, a 5% spread against a
335x compression. That is expected and worth stating: the compression is a
property of the scaler and the data, not of the optimiser. Whatever varies
between seeds, the input the network is handed does not.

**The collapse recurs on 4 of 5 seeds, not 5 of 5.** On seed 3 the network does
not degenerate to a constant — P(fail) std 3.64e-02 — but it does not recover
either, landing at AUC 0.9305 against 0.9999 under correct normalisation. So the
preprocessing reliably creates the conditions for the collapse and the collapse
is the usual outcome, but it is not certain. **Do not write "collapses on every
seed" anywhere.** An earlier draft of the paper said exactly that, which was
true at three seeds and false at five.

The other three targets never collapse on any seed. Per-timestep AUC is stable
to within 0.0004 across seeds on all four targets.

### A consequence for the diagnostic

Venus's grouped AUC spans 0.5338 to 0.9305 across seeds. That range **overlaps
what a merely-degraded target scores** — Mercury sits inside it on every seed
while discriminating normally. AUC therefore cannot distinguish a collapsed
model from a degraded one. Prediction spread can: the collapsed runs sit at
1.6e-05 to 4.8e-05 and every healthy run at ~4e-01, with nothing in between.

This sharpens C1's diagnostic claim from "prediction variance is a useful
check" to "prediction variance is the only one of the two that separates the
states", and it is a multi-seed result rather than an inference.

### The baseline-blindness half replicates completely

Across 5 seeds x 4 targets x 3 normalisation settings — 60 fitted trees — the
tree's AUC never leaves **0.9989–1.0000**, and within any one (seed, target) it
moves by at most **0.0003** between settings. There is no seed on which the
baseline notices anything is wrong.

This is the stronger of the two results and should be led with. The collapse is
one target's misfortune; a check that cannot fail is a property of the check.

### Status

- WP4 is closed for `norm_ablation` and `baseline_invariance`.
- `rare_mode_sweep` multi-seed is running; the economics table (C2) is still
  single-seed and remains open under WP4.
- `LIMITATIONS.md` §1 updated accordingly.
